- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
In House I decided to overload moveIn and moveOut to allow for multiple people to move in at once, using an arraylist. I did this because many people move into new houses with their families or roommates.
In Library I overloaded checkOut and returnBook to allow people to return multiple books at once, since this is something people do fairly often.
In Cafe I overloaded sellCoffee and restock. I made it so that sellCoffee without parameters would indicate a default coffee, which in this case is a 12oz black coffee. I also overloaded the restock method so you could restock one item at a time.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
In future I would try to make the overloaded restock method a bit more flexible since now it can only handle a very specific type of input. I think the map went well though and the overloaded methods I made feel fairly intuitive and they fit in well with the existing structure. I didn't quite finish off making it interactive but I started it off, so a user can enter, exit, and move floors in a building. I didn't want to get too in the weeds so I could focus on making my final project interactive, so I didn't implement everything.
